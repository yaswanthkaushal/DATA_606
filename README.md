Capstone Project

# Fake Amazon Review Detection
My project is to use natural language processing and machine learning techniques to create a model that would detect if a given review is a fake or real one.

# Dataset
The Amazon Customer Reviews dataset has been taken from the Amazon Customer Reviews Library and it contains 6900886 rows x 15 columns. This dataset does not have any labels for the review and I would be making a prediction based on the training the model from a labeled Amazon review dataset.

# Training Dataset
The dataset has 21000 records with reviews with labels for biased and unbiased reviews. The number of biased and unbiased reviews is equal i.e., 10500 records each. There are 700 reviews for each category with 350 biased and 350 unbiased reviews. The highest number of reviews have 5-star ratings.

# EDA on the Dataset

Code 1 - https://github.com/yaswanthkaushal/DATA_606/blob/main/1.%20DATA_606_Capstone_Project_TestingDataset_EDA.ipynb

I have cleaned the Unlabled Amazon Customer Reviews dataset and shown the EDA about the dataset.

# Training the Model and Testing

Code 2 - https://github.com/yaswanthkaushal/DATA_606/blob/main/2.%20DATA_606_Capstone_Project_EDA_%26_Model_Training_%26_Testing.ipynb

I have cleaned and showed EDA for the Labeled Amazon Reviews dataset and Trained Machine learning models and Predicted the reviews from Unlabled Amazon Customer Reviews dataset.

# Making the Prediction

Code 3 - https://github.com/yaswanthkaushal/DATA_606/blob/main/3.%20DATA_606_Capstone_Project_Results.ipynb

The prediction results on Unlabled Amazon Customer Reviews dataset by my trained models have been shown.
